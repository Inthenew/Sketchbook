# ðŸ“’ Sketchbook

Simple web based game engine built on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) focused on third-person character controls and related gameplay mechanics.

Mostly a playground for exploring how conventional third person gameplay mechanics found in modern games work and recreating them in a general way.
## Plans
All planned features can be found in the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Inthenew/Sketchbook/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
